        <h3>Short Stack Eatery</h3><br/>
        <p>This homey breakfast joint is known for their pancakes. I don’t know what Short Stack puts in them, but I do know they are highly addicting. And if you are craving them at 2am on a Saturday, you are in luck (!!!) because they are open 24/7 during the weekend.</p><br/>
        <h3>What do I recommend?</h3><br/>
        90% of the time I will order the sweet potato pancakes, but you can never go wrong with their more savory options. If you order a side of potatoes make sure you mix up the sour cream/hot sauce condiment and slather it on those taters!!</p>

        <h3>Gotham Bagels</h3><br/>
        <p>Gotham Bagels is true to their NY roots. Order at the counter and they will call your name out when it’s ready.</p><br/>
        <h3>What do I recommend?</h3><br/>
        <p>Everytime I go I’m always debating what to get because everything on the menu is so good. In the mood for lox? Try the Brighton Beach bagel. Want something a little more greasy? Order the O.M.F.G. Picky eater? Build your own bagel (hi Molly).</p>

        <h3>Madison Sourdough</h3><br/>
        <p>One of my favorite places outside of campus, is Willy Street, which is home to Madison Sourdough. When you walk inside you’ll immediately see the good stuff: carbs. My weakness is bread so it’s hard for me to walk out without buying at least one pastry. Besides the bread, the breakfast menu is full of quality, real food. You can taste the difference here.</p><br/>
        <h3>What do I recommend?</h3><br/>
        <p>Love the morning bun to curb my sweet tooth and for a classic breakfast go for the Bakers Breakfast.</p><br/>
